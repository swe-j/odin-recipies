<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Turn chicken breasts into a golden, crispy,
    garlicky, and juicy herb-infused chicken dish 
    that doesn't shy away from big flavor.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
    <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon dried basil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; 
        sprinkle with salt, black pepper, rosemary, and basil. 
        Arrange chicken in a large baking dish.
    </li>
    <li>Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes. 
        Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F 
        (190 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken meat 
        is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 
        45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
        inserted in the thickest part of the breast meat 
        should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
